## 🧠 What We Practiced / Learned

This project puts to use **everything taught in a modern React course**:

- Functional components
- Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)
- Routing with dynamic routes
- Redux for centralized state
- Calling and consuming APIs
- Handling loading and error states
- Creating a scalable folder structure
